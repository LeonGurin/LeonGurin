I started being interested in cybersecurity around May of 2022 and gained basic cybersecurity knowledge by doing [picoCTF](https://picoctf.org/ "picoCTF.org") and  [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/ "OverTheWire/wargames") wargames challenges. I've been participating in different CTFs since June just having fun learning.
